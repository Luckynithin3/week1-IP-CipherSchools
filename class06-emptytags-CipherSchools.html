    <!--Line Break-->
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <br>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could
    <br>
    To where it bent  in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then took the other,as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    Though as for that the passing there
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same, 
    <br>

        And both that morning equally lay
        <hr> 
        In leaves no step had trodden black.

    'The starlight Night' was
    one of two poems which Hopkins
    sent to his mother as a birthday present,

    the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'. 
        What a birthday present!
